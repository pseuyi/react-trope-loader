## usage

to use the trope loader animation, import as you would any react component wherever a loading animation is needed

```javascript
import { Component } from 'react'
import Loader from 'react-trope-loader'

export default class extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div>
        <Loader />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
